# Deployment Engine related configurations
#deployment:

# Currently there can be two modes
#  1. Scheduled Mode - (enable below property to "scheduled") - where the task runs periodically and trigger deployment
#  2. Triggered Mode - (enable below property to "triggered") - the deployment has to be triggered externally,
#   eg : in a worker node we don't need the task to run, but rather when we receive a
#        cluster msg,  the deployment has to be triggered manually
mode: scheduled

# Location of the artifact repository
repositoryLocation: ${carbon.home}/deployment/

# Deployment update interval in seconds. This is the interval between repository listener
# executions.
updateInterval: 15

# Notify deployment status via JMS to a topic
# In a cluster, all nodes should publish the status to the same topic which may be
# listened on to take deployment decisions such as reverting artifacts.
# This is disabled by default.
#
# Specify any static message content to be published as key-value pairs
# under staticMessageContent.
